DESCRIPTION:
Weather Data Visualization Project

This project fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes it, visualizes key metrics like temperature and humidity, and presents insights using a Streamlit dashboard.  

Features 
- Fetches live weather data for multiple cities.  
- Generates bar charts for temperature and humidity comparisons using Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- Creates an interactive dashboard using Streamlit for better visualization.  

Steps 
1. Set Up the Environment: Install dependencies using `pip install requests matplotlib seaborn pandas streamlit`.  
2. Fetch Weather Data: Use Pythonâ€™s `requests` module to retrieve weather details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.  
3. Visualize Data: Generate bar charts comparing weather metrics across cities.  
4. Build an Interactive Dashboard: Streamlit is used to display weather data tables and interactive visualizations.  
5. Upload to GitHub: The project is version-controlled and stored on GitHub for easy sharing.  

How to Run
- Run `python weather_visualization.py` to fetch data and generate plots.  
- Start the dashboard with `streamlit run dashboard.py` to view interactive charts.  

This project provides an easy way to analyze weather data and present insights visually.
